## 🌐 Welcome to My GitHub Universe

I’m passionate about understanding how people search for, use, and interact with information—and building systems that make that easier, clearer, and safer.  
From Chrome Extensions, to study-guide generators, to full-stack class projects, I focus on creating tools that help **students, knowledge workers, and everyday users** navigate information efficiently.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are some of the things I’ve built while studying Information Science:

### 🔹 **Study Guide Generator**
A tool that structures computer science & information science notes into chapters, Q&A formats, and clean study systems.

### 🔹 **Chrome Extension – Productivity Tools**
Lightweight tools to help organize online research and improve focus during browsing.

### 🔹 **Brightview**
A project focused on improving accessibility and user-centered design—built with principles from HCI and information architecture.

### 🔹 **Enterprise Solutions (1 & 2)**
Hands-on systems applying database logic, front-end structures, and real information workflows.

### 🔹 **Firebase Apps**
Apps exploring cloud-based data storage, authentication, and information retrieval (Moody App, MeGustaFirebase, etc.)
